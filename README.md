3D-Java
=======

A 3D Java Software Rendering Engine I wrote around 8 years ago. It has everything from Z-Buffering to triangle draw methods.


This is the project I learned Java in, the first thing I ever wrote which wasn't written Delphi. It contains some of the most cringe worthy code I've ever seen (swap methods, hard coded matrix multiplication...). I will refactor it to see how far I've come.
